## Branching Strategy
The project uses multiple branches to simulate a real development workflow:

- `main` – Stable production-ready code  
- `feature-ui-enhancement` – UI improvements and feature additions  
- `qa-testing` – Testing and verification changes  
- `hotfix-validation-error` – Bug fixes and corrections  
- `experimental-refactor` – Experimental code changes  

---

## Commit Strategy
Each commit represents a meaningful change, such as:
- UI enhancements
- Bug fixes
- Conflict resolution
- Documentation updates

This ensures a clear and readable project history.
