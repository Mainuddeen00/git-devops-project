# Git DevOps Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates practical usage of **Git Bash and GitHub** for version control as part of the **Fundamentals of DevOps (INT331)** course.

The main objective of this project is to **understand and implement Git concepts in a real-world workflow**, including repository initialization, branching strategies, merging, conflict resolution, and maintaining a clean commit history.

A **professional calculator web application** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** is used only as a **sample application** to apply and visualize Git operations.  
The **primary focus of this project is Git**, not application complexity.

---

## Project Focus (Important)
- This is a **Git-based DevOps project**
- The application is used only as a **medium**
- Evaluation is based on:
  - Git workflow
  - Branching strategy
  - Commits
  - Merges
  - Conflict resolution
  - GitHub usage

---

## Features Implemented (Application Side)
- Interactive calculator UI
- Keyboard input support
- Memory functions (MC, MR, M+, M-)
- Error handling (divide by zero)
- Responsive design
- Clean and professional UI styling
- Runs completely in the browser (no backend)

---

## Technologies Used
- **Git Bash**
- **GitHub**
- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript**
- **GitHub Pages (Deployment)**

---

## Git Concepts Covered
- Repository initialization
- Branch creation and management
- Feature-based branching strategy
- Switching between branches
- Merging branches into `main`
- Merge conflict creation and resolution
- Commit history tracking
- Remote repository synchronization
- GitHub Pages deployment

---

## Branching Strategy
The project uses multiple branches to simulate a real development workflow:

- `main`  
  Stable, production-ready code

- `feature-ui-enhancement`  
  UI improvements and feature additions

- `qa-testing`  
  Testing and verification changes

- `hotfix-validation-error`  
  Bug fixes and urgent corrections

- `experimental-refactor`  
  Experimental and refactoring changes

This branching strategy reflects **industry-level Git practices**.

---

## Commit Strategy
Each commit represents a **single meaningful change**, such as:
- UI enhancements
- Feature additions
- Bug fixes
- Merge conflict resolution
- Documentation updates

This ensures:
- Clean commit history
- Easy debugging
- Clear project progress tracking
